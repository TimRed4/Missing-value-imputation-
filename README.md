GAN-Based Imputation of Missing Time Series Data
This repository contains research and experimentation on applying Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for imputing missing values in time series data.

Overview
Time series data often suffers from missing values due to various reasons such as sensor failures, data corruption, or transmission issues. Traditional imputation methods (e.g., mean/median imputation, linear interpolation) may not capture the complex temporal patterns inherent in the data.

This project explores the use of GAN-based models, particularly TimeGAN and its variants, to learn realistic temporal dependencies and generate plausible replacements for missing values.
